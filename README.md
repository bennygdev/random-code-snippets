Repository showing random code snippets for any code related projects, might post any experimental mini tests with node, react or other languages.

# langaugeguesser
Basic langauge guesser using the langdetect and langs package. Once installed, go ahead and run in the terminal:
```npm install``` 
<br>
Once done, you can do ```node index.js '<your input>'``` and the program will go ahead and detect what langauge it is.
<br>
# givemeajoke
A nodejs program where it can tell you jokes and uses the give-me-a-joke package. Once installed, go ahead and run in the terminal:
```npm install```
<br>
Once done, you can do ```node index.js '<numbers between 1 - 5> <quantity>'``` (excluding single quotation marks) and the program will generate based on the argument given. First argument specifices what type the joke should be and quantity should be how many times will the joke be generated.
<br>
# namegenerator
Another simple nodejs program using process and process argv from node. Had too much fun experimenting with process argv and will move on to other nodejs packages. This generates a random name like how reddit gives you a random name when you create an account, this is oddly similar. Go ahead and run ```npm install```
<br>
Once done, you can do ```node index.js <mode> <numberofwords> <quantity> <number-yes-or-no>'``` (excluding single quotation marks). Mode: dashed, spaced, raw. numberofwords: any amount, quantity: any amount, number-yes-or-no: true or false<br>
